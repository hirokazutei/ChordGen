# CHORD-COMPOSER

There are already several chord-generators out there, such as [ChordPix](https://ChordPix.com), however, many of them fail to acommodate for instruments other than guitar.

#### Real Reason

I am building a simple app for myself to keep track of the songs I play on guitar and ukulele. I tried to download some chord images online but they are inconsistent in style, size, and some chord images are missing (especially custom chords). So I built this app so that I could get the images I need to build another app.

## What Does chord-composer offer?

### Chord-Composer offers quickly accessible Guitar/Ukelele ([or more if anyone wants to contribute](www.github.com)) chords!

### chord-composer offers the ability to customize your own custom chord!

#### Limitations

- Max 16 **strings**
- Max 16 **frets**
- No chords for instruments with changing string numbers across frets
  - I'm looking at you, Banjos
- Space limitations for the chord name
